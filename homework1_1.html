    <h1>Rules for Autocomplet</h1>

    <h3>
      Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application
      predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In Android and iOS[1]
      smartphones, this is called predictive text. In graphical user interfaces,
      users can typically press the tab key to accept a suggestion or the down
      arrow key to accept one of several.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Autocomplete speeds up human-computer interactions when it correctly
      predicts the word a user intends to enter after only a few characters have
      been typed into a text input field. It works best in domains with a
      limited number of possible words (such as in command line interpreters),
      when some words are much more common (such as when addressing an e-mail),
      or writing structured and predictable text (as in source code editors).
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Many autocomplete algorithms learn new words after the user has written
      them a few times, and can suggest alternatives based on the learned habits
      of the individual user.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Original purpose The original purpose of word prediction software was to
      help people with physical disabilities increase their typing speed,[2] as
      well as to help them decrease the number of keystrokes needed in order to
      complete a word or a sentence.[3] The need to increase speed is noted by
      the fact that people who use speech-generating devices generally produce
      speech at a rate that is less than 10% as fast as people who use oral
      speech.[4] But the function is also very useful for anybody who writes
      text, particularly people–such as medical doctors–who frequently use long,
      hard-to-spell terminology that may be technical or medical in nature.
